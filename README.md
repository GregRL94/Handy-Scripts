# The Mini-Games repository

This repository contains a collection of small scripts I have made, whether as homework for courses, or for friends, or for me, and thought they might come handy for some. It ranges from small games like lotery and hangman.

# Requirements

Here below the list of ALL used librairies in the repository. Please note that some scripts will use some packages and some scripts others. You don't have to install all packages to run any given script, only the ones which are mention in their respectivesection, which come later in this read-me.
